# 🔐 Signed URLs Implementation

## ✅ **Implementation Complete**

### **Overview**

Replaced public URLs with signed URLs for secure, time-limited access to resume files in Supabase Storage.

---

## 📋 **Changes Made**

### **1. StorageService Updates** (`/src/lib/services/storage.service.ts`)

#### **uploadResume()** - Returns 1-hour signed URL

```typescript
// Before: Public URL (insecure)
const {
  data: { publicUrl },
} = supabase.storage.from("resumes").getPublicUrl(fileName);

// After: Signed URL (secure, 1-hour expiration)
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage.from("resumes").createSignedUrl(fileName, 3600); // 1 hour
```

#### **getResumeUrl()** - Configurable expiration

```typescript
async getResumeUrl(
  userId: string,
  fileName: string,
  expiresIn = 3600  // Default: 1 hour
): Promise<string>
```

#### **getEmailResumeUrl()** - NEW: 30-day signed URLs for emails

```typescript
async getEmailResumeUrl(
  userId: string,
  fileName: string
): Promise<string> {
  // Returns signed URL valid for 30 days (2,592,000 seconds)
  const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
    .from("resumes")
    .createSignedUrl(path, 2592000);

  return data.signedUrl;
}
```

---

### **2. Onboarding Page Updates** (`/src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`)

#### **Resume Upload Flow**

```typescript
// Before: Public URL
const {
  data: { publicUrl },
} = supabase.storage.from("resumes").getPublicUrl(filePath);
resumeUrl = publicUrl;

// After: 30-day signed URL for email
const { data, error: signError } = await supabase.storage
  .from("resumes")
  .createSignedUrl(filePath, 2592000); // 30 days

resumeUrl = data.signedUrl;
```

**Why 30 days?**

- Owner needs time to review resume
- Email link remains valid for a month
- Balances security with usability

## 🔒 **Security Benefits**

### **Before (Public URLs)**

❌ Anyone with the URL can access the file  
❌ URLs never expire  
❌ No access control  
❌ Security risk for sensitive documents

### **After (Signed URLs)**

✅ Time-limited access (1 hour or 30 days)  
✅ Cryptographically signed  
✅ Automatic expiration  
✅ Secure for sensitive documents

## ⏱️ **Expiration Times**

| Use Case             | Duration | Seconds   | Method                                      |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Upload Response**  | 1 hour   | 3,600     | `uploadResume()`                            |
| **Dashboard View**   | 1 hour   | 3,600     | `getResumeUrl()`                            |
| **Email Attachment** | 30 days  | 2,592,000 | `getEmailResumeUrl()`                       |
| **Custom**           | Variable | Custom    | `getResumeUrl(userId, fileName, expiresIn)` |

## 📧 **Email Integration**

### **Onboarding Email Flow**

1. **User uploads resume** → File stored in Supabase Storage
2. **Generate 30-day signed URL** → Valid for owner to review
3. **Send email to owner** → Includes signed URL
4. **Owner clicks link** → Access granted (if within 30 days)
5. **URL expires** → After 30 days, link no longer works

### **Why 30 Days for Emails?**

- ✅ Owner has time to review multiple applications
- ✅ Reduces support requests ("link doesn't work")
- ✅ Still maintains security (not permanent)
- ✅ Can be regenerated if needed

---

## 🔄 **URL Regeneration**

If a signed URL expires, you can generate a new one:

```typescript
// Get new signed URL for existing file
const newUrl = await StorageService.getResumeUrl(
  userId,
  fileName,
  3600, // 1 hour
);

// Or for email (30 days)
const emailUrl = await StorageService.getEmailResumeUrl(userId, fileName);
```

## 🛡️ **Supabase Storage Policies**

### **Current Setup**

The storage bucket should have RLS policies that:

- ✅ Allow authenticated users to upload to their own folder
- ✅ Allow service role to access all files (for signed URLs)
- ✅ Deny public access (no public URLs)

### **Recommended Policies**

```sql
-- Allow users to upload to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload to own folder"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'resumes'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow users to read their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own files"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'resumes'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Service role can access all (for signed URLs)
-- This is automatic with service role key
```

## 📊 **Comparison**

### **Public URLs**

```
https://project.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/resumes/user123/resume.pdf
```

- ❌ Permanent access
- ❌ No expiration
- ❌ Anyone can access

### **Signed URLs**

```
https://project.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/sign/resumes/user123/resume.pdf?token=eyJ...&exp=1234567890
```

- ✅ Temporary access
- ✅ Expires after set time
- ✅ Cryptographically signed

---

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test Upload & Email**

1. Go to `/onboarding`
2. Fill form and upload resume
3. Submit form
4. Check owner email (`contact@fernandoaponte.dev`)
5. Click resume link in email
6. Verify file downloads
7. Wait 30 days (or manually expire) and verify link stops working

### **Test Expiration**

```typescript
// Generate 1-minute signed URL for testing
const testUrl = await supabase.storage.from("resumes").createSignedUrl(filePath, 60); // 1 minute

// Wait 2 minutes, try to access
// Should get 403 Forbidden
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate**

- ✅ Email integration updated
- ✅ Security improved

### **Optional Enhancements**

- [ ] Add URL refresh mechanism in dashboard
- [ ] Show expiration time in UI
- [ ] Add admin panel to regenerate expired URLs
- [ ] Implement download tracking
- [ ] Add file versioning

---

## 📝 **Environment Variables**

No new environment variables needed! Signed URLs use existing Supabase credentials:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...  # Used for signed URLs
```

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways**

1. **Signed URLs = Secure + Temporary**
   - Better than public URLs for sensitive files
   - Automatic expiration prevents unauthorized access

2. **Different Durations for Different Use Cases**
   - 1 hour: Quick access (uploads, dashboard)
   - 30 days: Email links (owner review)
   - Custom: Flexible for future needs

3. **No Breaking Changes**
   - Same API surface
   - Just returns signed URLs instead of public URLs
   - Backward compatible

4. **Production Ready**
   - Works with Supabase local and cloud
   - Secure by default
   - Easy to test and verify
